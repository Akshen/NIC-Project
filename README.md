# Chest X-Ray Abnormality Detection Project

This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for a project focused on the detection of abnormalities in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The project leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to assist in the diagnosis of diseases such as pneumonia and COVID-19 from radiographic images.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Develop and evaluate a computer-aided detection system for chest X-rays, aiming to support radiologists in identifying thoracic diseases.
- **Techniques:** Utilizes deep learning, specifically CNNs, for image classification and abnormality localization.
- **Datasets:** References to large-scale chest X-ray datasets and benchmark studies are included in the `papers/` directory.
- **Documentation:** The `editable_source/` folder contains editable DOCX versions of the main report and configuration manual.
